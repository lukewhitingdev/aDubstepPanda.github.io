		<img src="Assets/383850.jpg" class="big_story_img" style="height: 400px;">
		<p class="big_story_desc">A MANUFACTURER of specialist doors has spoken about the value of apprenticeship programmes with Oldham College.<br>

		Aspire Group 360 designs and makes metal doors for industries including food processing, agriculture, medicine and car production lines.<br> 

		The Chadderton firm has also made doors for luxury yachts and the Library of Birmingham archives.<br>

		The business is run by Louise Parfitt and husband Justin in Fields New Road and has 20 staff Â­- including a group of past and present apprentices.<br>

		As well as investing in staff training, Aspire has invested in manufacturing equipment to handle steel and aluminium fabrication and temperature-control and insulation materials.<br> 

		Louise (49) is a strong advocate of apprentices and said: "They bring in new skills and fresh thinking. I believe that everyone should have input into a business.<br>

		"Two years ago our workforce was quite mature and, though they are very experienced and skilled, we wanted more youth and ideas.<br> 

		"I'd definitely encourage other businesses to take on apprentices and I'd recommend young people to consider apprenticeships - especially girls. Engineering and manufacturing is now a high-skill, hi-tech industry."<br>

		The firm's current apprentices are Jack Holland and Luke Butterworth, who work with Oldham College on their programmes.<br>

		<div class="big_story_desc2">
			Jack (22) from Lees, has restricted hearing but is flourishing as an apprentice. After leaving Crompton House School he enrolled on a joinery course then did a series of temporary jobs.<br>

			He started at Aspire Group last summer on a one-year level two manufacturing operations apprenticeship. <br>

			He said: "I'm working on assembly and I love it because it brings together different trades and skills.<br>

			"Because I didn't get a maths qualification I'm studying that too at Oldham College. So far, I've done a level one maths course. Although I don't strictly need this for my apprenticeship, it's good to have it."<br> 

			He added: "I recommend apprenticeships. There are loads of opportunities and you earn while you learn."<br>

			Oldham College's employer engagement and recruitment manager, Linda Stokes said: "Apprenticeships are a valuable opportunity to prepare students for a professional career."<br>
