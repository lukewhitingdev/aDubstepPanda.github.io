		<h1 class="big_story_header"> SPRING-SUMMER 2017 OLDHAM BUSINESS EDGE OUT NOW </h1>
		<img src="Assets/mag_cover_4.jpg" class="big_story_img">
		<p class="big_story_desc"><br> THE latest edition of Oldham Business Edge magazine is out now and free to subscribers.

		<br>The quarterly magazine is produced by the Oldham Evening Chronicle in both print and digital formats.

		<br>The latest spring-summer 2017 edition features Gavin Wheeldon, chief executive of wi-fi technology firm Purple, on the front cover.

		<br>Purple has chosen Oldham over Manchester for its new HQ and the magazine hears about its arrival in Hollinwood, following a Â£5.4 million investment plan.

		<br>Purple is also recruiting more staff and Mr Wheeldon explains how Oldham's much-improved transport links, including trams and the M60 motorway, are among the factors behind choosing Hollinwood for the new head office 

		<br>He believes the area could become is a good location for other technology businesses but also raises some concerns about a shortage of offices and digitally-skilled workers.

		<br>Elsewhere the new edition of Oldham Business Edge highlights other local firms which are making important investments in facilities, skills and staff.
		<div class="big_story_desc2">
		<br>They include corrugated cardboard and repackaging specialist Ribble, which has installed new equipment and won important new contracts; and industrial door manufacturer Aspect Group 360, which works with Oldham College on apprenticeships and training.

		<br>The latest edition of the magazine also welcomes Clive Memmott, chief executive of Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce, and David Wadsworth, managing director of Cornerstone MD; who both write columns.

		<br>Elsewhere there is news about Pearson Solicitors and Financial Advisers' employment law packages, and the benefits of property auctions by Auction House Manchester, linked to Ryder and Dutton. 

		<br>We also highlight First Choice Homes' plans to build hundreds of new houses, management appointments and award news from Oldham Community Leisure, and the relaunch of the Oldham Enterprise Trust, backed by the Stoller Charitable Trust.

		<br>Our social-networking pages visit events at venues including Oldham's regenerated old town hall. The historic building now has an Odeon cinema, cafes, restaurants and a public square, and is nominated for a series of RIBA architecture awards.
