		OLDHAM Community Leisure has made two new appointments to its team, as Glenn Tolan joins as head of facilities and Steve Jacklin as operations and maintenance manager.
		Glenn Tolan started his leisure career in 1988 following a two-year apprenticeship at Barnsley Football Club. He has held a variety of roles in the sector, the most recent being head of operations for Barnsley Premier Leisure. 
		Glenn was responsible for all sport and leisure activities in Barnsley Premier Leisure’s seven venues, as well as four facilities in the Bassetlaw district and three independent health clubs in Doncaster, Pontefract and Mansfield.
		In his new role, Glenn will be responsible for the continuous improvement of OCL’s facilities, developing staff teams and providing excellent customer service.
		“I have a real passion for this industry and I relish the opportunity to make a real difference to the quality of life for the residents of Oldham. I’m looking forward to working with the teams at each of our sites to ensure we deliver the best possible services, programmes and facilities,” he said.
		Steve Jacklin joins OCL from Wythenshawe Forum, where he was technical manager. 
		Starting as an apprentice at  Manchester City Council, Steve has 34 years’ experience in the leisure sector with a variety of operators.

		<div class="big_story_desc2" style="margin-top: 20px;">
		He said: “The role of operations manager and maintenance manager is vital; it can range from mending a broken plug socket to overseeing building projects,” he said. 
		“Above all, it’s about keeping our facilities in prime condition.”
		Louise Walton, head of human resources at OCL, said, “We’re delighted to welcome Glenn and Steve. They have considerable experience and their expertise is a welcome addition to the team.”
