		<img src="Assets/1541311.jpg" class="big_story_img">
		<p class="big_story_desc">
			OLDHAM business people got a good look round Oldham’s beautifully repurposed and restored old town hall during a networking event at the new Odeon cinema.
			The £37million project includes neighbouring cafes, family restaurants and a new public square, Parliament Square, and is a key part of Oldham town centre’s regeneration. 
			The old hall’s courtrooms are now cinemas, but their original features have been retained including ornate furniture, balconies and ceilings.
			The Professional Oldham gathering included food and wine, presentations and a short film about the historic building’s redevelopment. The night was sponsored by Lees-based Caremark Oldham, which provides care and companionship services to adults and children.
			The business, established in 2011 by Stephanie Doherty and Helan Graham, brought together two women who had previously worked together and pooled redundancy money to start the business. 
			Caremark now has just under 50 employees, has won two Oldham business awards and has a number of accreditations for its services and record as an employer. It also supports the Get Oldham Working campaign.
			Stephanie outlined Caremark’s range of services and, considering memories of the old town hall, spoke about Caremark’s services for people with memory loss, dementia and Alzheimer’s.

		<div class="big_story_desc2">
			Odeon manager Paul Dagg told the gathering of his excitement about the redevelopment –and suggested the venue would be an ideal place for business and social events.
			Guests watched a short documentary film by Dan Dubowitz about the old hall’s history, which featured interviews with Oldham people recalling their memories and feelings about the site which, as most Oldhamers know, had good and bad times before its regeneration. 
			Professional Oldham organisers include Pearson Solicitors and Financial Advisers, Dr Kershaw’s Hospice, Limetree PR, Caremark and Oldham Business Edge magazine. The evening’s compere was Robbie MacDonald of Oldham Business Edge magazine and business editor of the Oldham Chronicle. 
			Guests included Simon Dawson and Julie Hughes, of Shaw-based manufacturer Dawson Precision Engineering.
